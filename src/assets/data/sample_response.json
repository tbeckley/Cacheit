My wife and I make a combined income now of just shy of $200k.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She is using her income to pay the mortgage and groceries combined total of ~ $1,200 monthly and I am paying for our vehicles, utilities, car insurance  for a total of ~ $1,000. The one vehicle I&amp;#39;m paying 0.9% and the other one at 1.9%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That combined and incidentals of having a social life we are at about $2,500 a month in expenses. We live fairly frugal, don&amp;#39;t spend much at restaurants and such. We have a $20k in savings and my wife&amp;#39;s student loans for her master&amp;#39;s kicked in beginning of the year and has a $10K remaining.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since taking the position I&amp;#39;ve paid off all of my credit card debt of ~$4k and am now focusing on helping my wife pay off her student loan since they&amp;#39;re at 4.5% and would like to knock out that debt. We don&amp;#39;t have any retirement accounts or anything like this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What should my next steps be? For now I just have my income sitting in a savings account earning 1.45%. Now, both of our credit scores are in the 810-820 range (not sure if that matters for this). What will my best future planning be?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; I got asked by mods to remove a certain website.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been in marketing for ~10 years but have spent the last 4 years building my qualifications and certifications after noticing stagnation in income, which I believe is due to me only having 1 year at a community college when younger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly enough, most of the extra skillsets that made me more marketable were by subscribing to &lt;del&gt;had to remove&lt;/del&gt; and teaching myself through online research and reviewing market studies. It felt like I enrolled myself into my own college making me solely responsible for my education. I worked my ass off teaching myself the last 4 years from knowing minimal marketing to having every certification and skillset under the sun to put myself where I am now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bottom line, lots of hard work teaching myself all the skillsets to move into a larger role while I kept the smaller role.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW DID YOU GET THE MOTIVATION TO TEACH YOURSELF?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started running around the same time I began pushing myself to try harder. For me, I learned rewards don&amp;#39;t work, plain and simple. They just made me lazier. All my work was from home so I&amp;#39;d work 4 hours, go on a run, work a few more hours, go on another run. Helps me keep focus on what&amp;#39;s important to me and get those goals accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m sure people will find excuses and say, HEY I WORK ALL DAY IN AN OFFICE, I CAN&amp;#39;T DO THAT... that&amp;#39;s just you convincing yourself you&amp;#39;re incapable and will continue to be that way. Make the effort, reap the rewards, and stop making excuses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I felt better about myself from running, it reflected in my goals. I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s a perfect answer for everyone, but if you find things that make you happier and healthier, that happiness and hard work can reflect into your career as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ARE YOU HIRING?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not right now but one word of advice I can give you is a lot of people feel more comfortable applying to 50-60K jobs then the 100K+ jobs. I used to review incoming resumes and you&amp;#39;ll get 400+ applicants for the $50K position and maybe 10 applicants for $100K+ positions. Since I knew that info, I only applied to positions hiring for over $100k.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIMILIAR SITUATION, QUESTION ON LIFESTYLE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For me, I grew up poor.

I started installing as a labor, learned quite a bit, and got raised to $16/hr mid 2017. We often worked a lot of hours (100+) and we sometimes had a week or week and a half off duty. The reason I chose this job is because it&amp;#39;s a small company and my dad has been working here for 16 years now, he raised me on this job and I know the owners, who are involved, very well. I think that my dad does okay for himself as he is the foreman for the install crew and is salaried right at $90k regardless of the hours he works or what he does. Toward the end of 2017, our sales rep (bosses SIL) announced he was moving to another company. I took the opportunity to talk to my boss and see if he would be open to training me and helping me take over for that position, to which he agreed. I moved into the office on the first monday of march (the 5th). My pay is at $16/hr. I can come in when i like (generally around 9) and leave when I like as well, same thing with lunch. I try and do 40 hours weekly and enjoy the benefits of being able to take off if I need to/want to a bit early etc.\nMy current pay is 640 a week, after a $30 weekly 401k contribution (3% employer match) and taxes (fed w/h, SS, Medicare) i take home $519.04 a week. I should also mention my company does provide medical and dental. (I don&amp;#39;t pay anything). Also since I&amp;#39;m moving into sales I believe my commission is going to be somewhere around 5% but I do not want to count any of this into my earnings because that 5% on costs (1/2 the sale) is based solely on my performance selling jobs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as savings and stuff, I blew through almost everything I&amp;#39;ve made since I began working. I saw my W-2 this year and got mad at myself for it. After almost 2 years of working at a job that pays better than most of my friends all I have to show for is a beat up 02 civic, an 87 caprice classic (was nice untill I hit a deer), $6.5k in savings that I don&amp;#39;t touch for any reason, and the memories of good times with friends, cars that I destroyed, girls, eating out, movies, shopping etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Debts:\n~$30k on a 2018 Subaru Impreza sport I just bought.\n($480 monthly that begins 04/14/18)\n$3,088 that will begin on 04/7/18 (I&amp;#39;m getting braces as this is something that I want to do for my image to help boost self esteem and feel more confident with myself (no one has told me anything yet but &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; dislike my teeth)\n(2 x $200 + 24 x $112 monthly payments at a dental place)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Car: I bought the subaru for various reasons. While many of you might feel like reprimanding me for it and I totally understand why, I feel like I can justify this purchase well enough. I live in an area where we get a bunch of snow and Icy roads in the winter. An awd vehicle with studded tires is a godsend up here. The car is a 2.0 hatchback. A small naturally aspired 4 cyl engine won&amp;#39;t be doing any insane speeds or anything so it will keep me out of trouble and safe. A hatch is good for groceries and carrying some light stuff around for when I do settle down and possibly have kids, I intend on keeping this car for at leas a decade. It&amp;#39;s a very subtle car that will keep me out of trouble with the law. Subaru&amp;#39;s are known for reliability and their safety (basically has an airbag curtain). While my beater 02 civic (Hood doesn&amp;#39;t latch completely, left fender is fucked from a snow cable that broke, rear end is fucked from a truck that rear ended me last year) has 172k miles and is reliable (I am willing to hold a bet that it will get me coast to coast if anyone is interested), I am aware that I would be looked down upon If someone I was meeting with saw me pull up to a meeting or job walk through in that. That &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; one of the reasons I bought it as well but I do overall like the car and I am happy with my purchase. I have only used the car for work locally so far (maybe 40 miles in 3 weeks) and I have not spoken with my boss about a fuel card or car allowance. I do not want to be pushy on the matter but once he asks me to take it for a long drive for a project I will ask him for some sort of car allowance, the few times I drove my civic to projects when I was in the field, I was always given fuel, so I know that I am not expected to put my own fuel. Any advice on how to speak with him on car allowance is also greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Expenses:\nI still live with my parents as I have a good relationship with them as such I do not pay much as far as rent goes.\n$95/mo phone bill (should drop ~$35 soon as I&amp;#39;m about to finish paying off my phone (S8+) and probably won&amp;#39;t upgrade for a couple of years)\n$120/ mo that I pay my mom for food a month (cheap asf god bless her)\n$60/ mo that I pay my mom for doing my laundry\n$100-250/ mo I handle the electricity bill and the water as well which varies. Overall I have $500 worth of expenses each month that can be categorized as &amp;quot;rent&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other stuff that I spend on is occasionally eating out or movies with my gf and gas of course although I do not track any of this for the most part (sorry will start now)(please advise on how to track). all I have at the moment is $1,165 in checkings and I will need to take from there to insure my car (my dad&amp;#39;s going to put me on his insurance so shouldn&amp;#39;t be that bad) hopefully I won&amp;#39;t have to take from savings. Then next week I will have to register my car as well as plate it (somewhere around $400 according to my DMV&amp;#39;s website.) so there goes my next paycheck lol. After next week I should be ready to start actually handling finances as well as improving my savings and getting on track financially.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should mention that I didn&amp;#39;t have much &amp;quot;nice&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;office&amp;quot; clothes before hand so I did go on a bit of a shopping spree before I moved into the office. I bought about 8 dress shirts (will be buying more soon), 4 jackets/blazers, and about 12 slacks, I already had one pair of dress shoes so I didn&amp;#39;t purchase any more although I want to get another pair soon. I hope that you guys will be happy to know that I spent a grand total of $90 because I went thrifting for all this instead of buying new (probs over $900 all new). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Goals:\nI want to save up enough money to buy a double wide mobile home. My reasoning behind this is that I should be able to do this whilst living with my parents. Once I have the cash on hand to purchase a mobile home I can find a friend or 2 to rent out rooms too so as to not have to worry about lot rent etc since my ~$30k &amp;quot;investment&amp;quot; will generate this for me. Once I accomplish this I wish to grow as big of savings as I can to look towards buying a house without having to stress about selling my mobile home for a down payment. This will probably be once I settle down and decide to start a family. When I finally go to buy a house I would like to keep my mobile home to generate rent for me and help me with my mortgage payment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;School:\nI tried to go to community college for a bit and while I do good at school and I wouldn&amp;#39;t consider myself dumb, I never liked school. I took honors and AP classes throughout high school so I have a few college credits but I just really do not want to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Career: As far as my overall career is concerned I am very happy where I&amp;#39;m at and I am aware that I will see increase in pay as I gain more experience. My boss has sort of guided me through what I should be doing and mostly lets me do my own thing in trying to find jobs and stuff. Next week he&amp;#39;s going to be introducing me to some long term contacts. Although this is only my 3rd week I&amp;#39;m on the verge of closing a decent sized contract ($150k for about 7 days) so fingers crossed on that. I think I&amp;#39;m happy where I&amp;#39;m at currently and if in the future I&amp;#39;m not once I get some experience under my belt I may switch companies if I see that this place no longer benefits me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I need help with:\nHow do you guys recommend I handle my finances to better and quicker reach my goals. As well as any advice on saving some money without staying at home 100% of the time and not having a social life. Also any advice on how to speak with my boss on a car allowance is greatly appreciated, what are key points you guys think I should bring up and what seems like a fair rate to ask for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you all for taking the time to read all the way through, and thanks in advance for any and all the help! I will try to respond as much as I can and I will make sure to read through all of the replies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
                    "selftext": "Okay, I just made this account to use at my work lol.\nSo about my job, I'm 19 and have worked at this place since I got out of high school (2016), I worked for like 6 months and made $20k, 2017 worked all year and made ~40k (I'm not entirely sure).\nWe make industrial type floor coatings and install them at various restaurants and production plants throughout the western us. I started installing as a labor, learned quite a bit, and got raised to $16/hr mid 2017. We often worked a lot of hours (100+) and we sometimes had a week or week and a half off duty. The reason I chose this job is because it's a small company and my dad has been working here for 16 years now, he raised me on this job and I know the owners, who are involved, very well. I think that my dad does okay for himself as he is the foreman for the install crew and is salaried right at $90k regardless of the hours he works or what he does. Toward the end of 2017, our sales rep (bosses SIL) announced he was moving to another company. I took the opportunity to talk to my boss and see if he would be open to training me and helping me take over for that position, to which he agreed. I moved into the office on the first monday of march (the 5th). My pay is at $16/hr. I can come in when i like (generally around 9) and leave when I like as well, same thing with lunch. I try and do 40 hours weekly and enjoy the benefits of being able to take off if I need to/want to a bit early etc.\nMy current pay is 640 a week, after a $30 weekly 401k contribution (3% employer match) and taxes (fed w/h, SS, Medicare) i take home $519.04 a week. I should also mention my company does provide medical and dental. (I don't pay anything). Also since I'm moving into sales I believe my commission is going to be somewhere around 5% but I do not want to count any of this into my earnings because that 5% on costs (1/2 the sale) is based solely on my performance selling jobs.\n\nAs far as savings and stuff, I blew through almost everything I've made since I began working. I saw my W-2 this year and got mad at myself for it. After almost 2 years of working at a job that pays better than most of my friends all I have to show for is a beat up 02 civic, an 87 caprice classic (was nice untill I hit a deer), $6.5k in savings that I don't touch for any reason, and the memories of good times with friends, cars that I destroyed, girls, eating out, movies, shopping etc.\n\nDebts:\n~$30k on a 2018 Subaru Impreza sport I just bought.\n($480 monthly that begins 04/14/18)\n$3,088 that will begin on 04/7/18 (I'm getting braces as this is something that I want to do for my image to help boost self esteem and feel more confident with myself (no one has told me anything yet but **I** dislike my teeth)\n(2 x $200 + 24 x $112 monthly payments at a dental place)\n\nCar: I bought the subaru for various reasons. While many of you might feel like reprimanding me for it and I totally understand why, I feel like I can justify this purchase well enough. I live in an area where we get a bunch of snow and Icy roads in the winter. An awd vehicle with studded tires is a godsend up here. The car is a 2.0 hatchback. A small naturally aspired 4 cyl engine won't be doing any insane speeds or anything so it will keep me out of trouble and safe. A hatch is good for groceries and carrying some light stuff around for when I do settle down and possibly have kids, I intend on keeping this car for at leas a decade. It's a very subtle car that will keep me out of trouble with the law. Subaru's are known for reliability and their safety (basically has an airbag curtain). While my beater 02 civic (Hood doesn't latch completely, left fender is fucked from a snow cable that broke, rear end is fucked from a truck that rear ended me last year) has 172k miles and is reliable (I am willing to hold a bet that it will get me coast to coast if anyone is interested), I am aware that I would be looked down upon If someone I was meeting with saw me pull up to a meeting or job walk through in that. That *is* one of the reasons I bought it as well but I do overall like the car and I am happy with my purchase. I have only used the car for work locally so far (maybe 40 miles in 3 weeks) and I have not spoken with my boss about a fuel card or car allowance. I do not want to be pushy on the matter but once he asks me to take it for a long drive for a project I will ask him for some sort of car allowance, the few times I drove my civic to projects when I was in the field, I was always given fuel, so I know that I am not expected to put my own fuel. Any advice on how to speak with him on car allowance is also greatly appreciated.\n\nExpenses:\nI still live with my parents as I have a good relationship with them as such I do not pay much as far as rent goes.\n$95/mo phone bill (should drop ~$35 soon as I'm about to finish paying off my phone (S8+) and probably won't upgrade for a couple of years)\n$120/ mo that I pay my mom for food a month (cheap asf god bless her)\n$60/ mo that I pay my mom for doing my laundry\n$100-250/ mo I handle the electricity bill and the water as well which varies. Overall I have $500 worth of expenses each month that can be categorized as \"rent\"\n\nOther stuff that I spend on is occasionally eating out or movies with my gf and gas of course although I do not track any of this for the most part (sorry will start now)(please advise on how to track). all I have at the moment is $1,165 in checkings and I will need to take from there to insure my car (my dad's going to put me on his insurance so shouldn't be that bad) hopefully I won't have to take from savings. Then next week I will have to register my car as well as plate it (somewhere around $400 according to my DMV's website.) so there goes my next paycheck lol. After next week I should be ready to start actually handling finances as well as improving my savings and getting on track financially.\n\nI should mention that I didn't have much \"nice\" or \"office\" clothes before hand so I did go on a bit of a shopping spree before I moved into the office. I bought about 8 dress shirts (will be buying more soon), 4 jackets/blazers, and about 12 slacks, I already had one pair of dress shoes so I didn't purchase any more although I want to get another pair soon. I hope that you guys will be happy to know that I spent a grand total of $90 because I went thrifting for all this instead of buying new (probs over $900 all new). \n\nGoals:\nI want to save up enough money to buy a double wide mobile home. My reasoning behind this is that I should be able to do this whilst living with my parents. Once I have the cash on hand to purchase a mobile home I can find a friend or 2 to rent out rooms too so as to not have to worry about lot rent etc since my ~$30k \"investment\" will generate this for me. Once I accomplish this I wish to grow as big of savings as I can to look towards buying a house without having to stress about selling my mobile home for a down payment. This will probably be once I settle down and decide to start a family. When I finally go to buy a house I would like to keep my mobile home to generate rent for me and help me with my mortgage payment. \n\nSchool:\nI tried to go to community college for a bit and while I do good at school and I wouldn't consider myself dumb, I never liked school. I took honors and AP classes throughout high school so I have a few college credits but I just really do not want to go.\n\nCareer: As far as my overall career is concerned I am very happy where I'm at and I am aware that I will see increase in pay as I gain more experience. My boss has sort of guided me through what I should be doing and mostly lets me do my own thing in trying to find jobs and stuff. Next week he's going to be introducing me to some long term contacts. Although this is only my 3rd week I'm on the verge of closing a decent sized contract ($150k for about 7 days) so fingers crossed on that. I think I'm happy where I'm at currently and if in the future I'm not once I get some experience under my belt I may switch companies if I see that this place no longer benefits me.\n\nWhat I need help with:\nHow do you guys recommend I handle my finances to better and quicker reach my goals. As well as any advice on saving some money without staying at home 100% of the time and not having a social life. Also any advice on how to speak with my boss on a car allowance is greatly appreciated, what are key points you guys think I should bring up and what seems like a fair rate to ask for.\n\nThank you all for taking the time to read all the way through, and thanks in advance for any and all the help! I will try to respond as much as I can and I will make sure to read through all of the replies.",

I have about $2800 in my checking, and have an internship starting this summer that pays well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I consider myself to be financially responsible, sometimes to a fault as said by my mother and girlfriend. I have a tough time shelling out money for events or outings such as going out to the bars, going skiing, movie theaters, etc. because they are very expensive for how long you get to enjoy them. For example if I buy a video game, I can expect usually at the very least $1/hour of enjoyment from the purchase. Movies are like $10/hour. Going to bars can be like $20/hour. Skiing is $25/hour. People also want to do these kinds of things multiple times a week which I think adds up super fast. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m just kind of teetering between “this stuff is too expensive for what I get” and “if I won’t spend money then my life will just be video games and cheap food”. For example I want to get into backyard astronomy, but a $200 telescope is a lot of money. Will I spend 200 hours outside to make it $1/hour? Or is this hobby WORTH $4/hour or something else? Are going out to the bars worth spending $20/hour?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do spend money on these types of experiences but I typically fight the opportunities. I also worry about having money after I graduate. Doesn’t it make sense to try and save this kind of money until I have a permanent source of income in case I need it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’d just like to see what other people do to manage spending money and how they decide if it’s worth the money to do something.

I have a tough time shelling out money for events or outings such as going out to the bars, going skiing, movie theaters, etc. because they are very expensive for how long you get to enjoy them. For example if I buy a video game, I can expect usually at the very least $1/hour of enjoyment from the purchase. Movies are like $10/hour. Going to bars can be like $20/hour. Skiing is $25/hour. People also want to do these kinds of things multiple times a week which I think adds up super fast. \n\nI’m just kind of teetering between “this stuff is too expensive for what I get” and “if I won’t spend money then my life will just be video games and cheap food”. For example I want to get into backyard astronomy, but a $200 telescope is a lot of money. Will I spend 200 hours outside to make it $1/hour? Or is this hobby WORTH $4/hour or something else? Are going out to the bars worth spending $20/hour?\n\nI do spend money on these types of experiences but I typically fight the opportunities. I also worry about having money after I graduate. Doesn’t it make sense to try and save this kind of money until I have a permanent source of income in case I need it?\n\nI’d just like to see what other people do to manage spending money and how they decide if it’s worth the money to do something. Thanks!\n\n",

But it feels like I’m just burning money with the crazy high interest rates on my credit cards; even after following the advice of that post on here the other day to call and lower my APR for them the average is still about 21% APR per card. I feel like it might not be the worst idea to take out a personal loan to zero them out and then just make a single monthly payment on that at the new lower interest rate. I know it’s not an excessive amount of credit card debt and I could be a lot worse off but with my current income being stretched pretty thin it stings every time I see a large portion of my payments just going to accrued interest. Is this a good idea or am I missing something? And if it is, what are some of the more reputable institutions I can apply for a loan that have a reasonable interest rates?
