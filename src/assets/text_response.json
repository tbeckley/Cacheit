The second week of him working there, he noticed that the \u201chours worked,\u201d on his paycheck were different from his time sheet. He thought that suspicious, so he checked all of the hours he worked since working there, went home that night and calculated his hours worked, to how much he\u2019s been paid. After adding everything up, he indeed was getting shorted on hours, and they owe him about $80 worth of hourly wages, already in his short stint of working there. My friend is a very reserved person, keeps to himself and doesn\u2019t talk to much, so he didn\u2019t know how to go about bringing it up. He was nervous. But, he also wasn\u2019t about to miss out on $80 he was owed! So, he did the only other thing he could think of.... he decided it best to, on his next day of work right before closing, take the $80 out of the till and just never return to the Jack in the Box again. Well, it seems someone found out the next morning that $80 was missing from the till and was not happy about it, so they checked the cameras. They saw my friend take the money and IMMEDIATELY call the police. They go to HIS SCHOOL and arrest him for theft (or something of the sort) and he had to serve 3 days in jail because he was 18. To add insult to injury they also made him pay $80 in restitution. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

After adding everything up, he indeed was getting shorted on hours, and they owe him about $80 worth of hourly wages, already in his short stint of working there. My friend is a very reserved person, keeps to himself and doesn\u2019t talk to much, so he didn\u2019t know how to go about bringing it up. He was nervous. But, he also wasn\u2019t about to miss out on $80 he was owed! So, he did the only other thing he could think of.... he decided it best to, on his next day of work right before closing, take the $80 out of the till and just never return to the Jack in the Box again. Well, it seems someone found out the next morning that $80 was missing from the till and was not happy about it, so they checked the cameras. They saw my friend take the money and IMMEDIATELY call the police. They go to HIS SCHOOL and arrest him for theft (or something of the sort) and he had to serve 3 days in jail because he was 18. To add insult to injury they also made him pay $80 in restitution. ",

I handled this really well and was praised a lot. I somehow managed to do his entire job + my production duties. Things were running smoothly with very few mistakes. When we hired the new guy I was his guide for the first couple of weeks showing him the ropes, our processes etc. Once he was comfortable I was then moved back into production permanently. Obviously not where I wanted to be so I was a bit frustrated. At this point I was earning around \u00a318,000 a year with the most experience in several roles in the company, something no one else was capable of.

Not a bad position to be in really.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>13 months ago I decided to pick up a programming language after talking to the new guy and it went really well, I actually managed to automate a lot of my IT job and 8 months ago I was moved into the office full time. This was amazing, a new person was hired in my old production job and I could focus on what I was doing upstairs full time. I got a payrise to \u00a319,000 and was happy. Until I realised people in my team that do a lot less than me, a lot less capable and can&#39;t work several different roles in the company were earning almost twice as much as me. Especially when I have 6 1/2 years experience and they have 2-3 and younger than me. Obviously other peoples pay shouldn&#39;t be any of my business and I should be paid on how well I do etc. Also in the &#39;IT team&#39; there&#39;s 3 of us. I can cover for them both, none of them can cover for eachother and they never will. I am their only cover. Also I am the only cover for the production room. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We also have a bonus scheme. Each month every employee (there&#39;s 10-15 employees) earns commission based on our profits. Mine is 0.2% which ranges between a 100-300 bonus each month. Everyone else is on 0.5%. Some months that&#39;s a \u00a3700 bonus against my \u00a3300 bonus. Ok fair enough, maybe get my head down, work hard and earn a payrise and then talk with my boss about it.

On the Friday my boss told me I now need to &#39;start working smarter&#39; by moving between the two jobs again.

Basically doing two peoples jobs, again. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not sure if my experience warrants a payrise and I&#39;m worried about asking. I&#39;ve never asked before. I just feel like no matter how long I&#39;ve been here, I&#39;ll always be that &#39;apprentice&#39; that can be moved around on command and cover peoples job.

In sum, it was a path I could manage financially, time-wise, and with natural skills I was aware I had.

This new state of being - entirely a first for me - allowed for more time to really examine my life.
